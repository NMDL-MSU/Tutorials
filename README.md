# NMDL HPCC Tutorials

The NMDL tutorials contain detailed pseudocode and bash scripts to run bioinformatic pipelines for RNA-seq data. We will be using the Michigan State University High Performing Computer (HPC) in these tutorials, so you must have an active account. These tutorials do not require prior knowledge of LINUX nor specific coding skills. If you do not have previous experience with the HPC, the first tutorial goes over basic commands you will need to know.
