# NMDL HPCC Tutorials

The NMDL tutorials go over basic skills needed to work with Michigan State University High Performing Computer, detailed pseudocode and bash scripts to run bioinformatic pipelines. These tutorials do not require prior knowledge of LINUX nor specific coding skills. 

The expectation is to add a new module every week if time permits.
